## Getting Started

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in Rust, serving as a practical way to learn Rust's ownership model, pattern matching, and other language features. Additionally, I will also implement data structures and algorithms in Rust.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended).
- Cargo (Rust's package manager, included with Rust installation).
